## Assignment of a CDS View to a Transaction Code (T-Code) 

### Summary 📋
Assigning a CDS View to a transaction code allows users to access the view directly through a shortcut in SAP GUI or Fiori, simplifying navigation.

**1. Steps Overview:**
- Create a New Transaction Code (T-Code):

**2. Use SE93 to create the transaction code.**
- Link CDS View to the T-Code:
- In SE93, select the "Program and Selection Screen" or "Report" option if the CDS is used within a report or Fiori App.
- Alternatively, link the T-Code to an Application UI that consumes the CDS view. 
**3. Usage:**
- Once created, the transaction code acts as a direct entry point, simplifying access to the CDS view.

**Purpose:**
- Facilitates quick access to reports or applications based on CDS views.
- Avoids complex menu navigation for end-users.
- This process ensures that business users or analysts can efficiently access key data through a simple T-Code shortcut
